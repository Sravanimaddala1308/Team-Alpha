            <p>Hi, I'm Simhadri Mohith, and I'm currently pursuing my pre-final year of B.Tech in CSE(AIML) at GVPCE(A), Visakhapatnam. I am a passionate and dedicated student with a keen interest in technology and innovation.</p>
    
            <p>I have gained experience in various programming languages such as C, C++, Python, SQL, Java, HTML, and CSS. I have also worked with technologies like Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Robotic Process Automation. I am proud to have been a Core Team member in GDSC (Google Developer Student Club), where I served as the GDSC ML Lead in college. Additionally, I have actively participated in Devfest 2022 event by GDG (Google Developer Groups).</p>
    
            <p>As a student, I have participated in several programming competitions and hackathons. I have volunteered in the event HTM (Hack The Mountains)-3.0 in college, where I had the opportunity to apply my skills in real-world scenarios. I also participated in the coding contest "Hunt The Code" in college, where I honed my skills in problem-solving and critical thinking.</p>
    
            <p>Apart from programming, I enjoy reading and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in the tech industry. I also like to explore new places and try out different cuisines.</p>
    
            <p>Thank you for taking the time to read my profile, and I look forward to connecting with you!</p>
